"""
This script handles the generation of "Bijlage 3" documents, which are based on ORA
(Onderhoudsrapportage) files. It identifies the most recent ORA file in a given directory,
checks if a corresponding "Bijlage 3" file already exists, and generates a PDF if necessary.

The script performs the following steps:
1. Searches for files starting with "Bijlage 3" in the specified directory.
2. Identifies the most recently modified ORA file if no "Bijlage 3" file exists.
3. Runs a macro on the ORA file to export it as a PDF.
4. Saves the generated PDF in the appropriate directory.

Functions:
- `file_starts_with_bijlage3`: Checks if any file in a directory starts with "Bijlage 3".
- `run_macro_on_workbook`: Executes a macro to generate a PDF from an Excel workbook.

Dependencies:
- `os`: For file and directory operations.
- `logging`: For logging script activity and errors.
- `src.utils`: Custom utility functions for configuration and logging setup.
- `src.export_excel_to_pdf`: Handles macro execution for exporting Excel sheets to PDF.

Usage:
Run this script directly to generate "Bijlage 3" documents for all objects in the batch.
